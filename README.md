##Frequently Asked Questions

#####Can more than one widget be added?

Yes. You can add as many widgets as you want.

#####Why does loading time increase with the number of CGS Latest Post widgets added?

The CGSociety forum has a minimum request time between two consequetive requests. Hence, each widget instance has to wait for this interval.

However, the widgets use caching for fast performance, so the widgets don't need to load all details for every request.
You can set the cache timeout in Settings -> CGS Latest Posts Options page.
